# AI Defense Hackathon

## A real-time air-to-sea multi-modal drone sentry system for anomaly detection, object detection, and anti-submarine defense and deterrence

### Description: A sentry system that dispatches air-to-sea drones from a central submarine/naval carrier or other military base to monitor submarine routes, undersea communication cables, mine detection, mitigate illegal immigration, etc using AI agents. The system sends information back to the home base in real-time and uses an agentic system to plan emergency responses, actions, and give recommendations to the relevant agencies (ICE, US Navy, etc).
