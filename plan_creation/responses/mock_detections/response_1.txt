## Drone Threat Response Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date Issued:** October 26, 2023
**Security Level:** RESTRICTED

This document outlines the procedures for responding to a detected drone threat. All personnel involved must be familiar with this plan and their assigned roles.

**I. THREAT INFORMATION**

*   **Detected Object(s):** Drone
*   **Threat Level:** Medium
*   **Location:** Latitude 34.0522, Longitude -118.2437, Altitude 150.0 meters
*   **Conditions:** Dusk - Clear
*   **Raw Description:** Unidentified drone detected flying at 150m altitude near sector 4.

**II. THREAT ANALYSIS**

**Potential Intent:** Reconnaissance, surveillance, or delivery (potential for malicious payload).

**Capabilities:** Aerial observation, data collection, potential for carrying small payloads (explosives, contraband).

**Immediate Concerns:** Proximity to Sector 4, altitude suggests potential for beyond-visual-line-of-sight operation, unknown operator intent.

**III. RESPONSE PLAN**

**A. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (0-5 Minutes):**

1.  **CONFIRM & ALERT:**
    *   **Action:** Verify drone detection via secondary system (visual, radar).
    *   **Action:** Issue immediate alert to Security Team Alpha, Supervisor On-Duty, and Airspace Control.
    *   **Responsible Party:** Airspace Control/Initial Detection System Operator

2.  **ESTABLISH VISUAL:**
    *   **Action:** Deploy Security Team Alpha to establish visual contact with the drone. Prioritize safe observation point.
    *   **Responsible Party:** Security Team Alpha

3.  **GEO-FENCE NOTIFICATION:**
    *   **Action:** Immediately notify Airspace Control of the unauthorized drone presence and location.
    *   **Action:** Request temporary geo-fence activation around Latitude 34.0522, Longitude -118.2437, Radius 500 meters, Altitude 500 ft.
    *   **Responsible Party:** Airspace Control

**B. ASSESSMENT & CONTAINMENT (5-15 Minutes):**

1.  **DRONE TRACKING:**
    *   **Action:** Airspace Control to continuously track drone's flight path, speed, and altitude.
    *   **Action:** Attempt to identify drone type and markings.
    *   **Responsible Party:** Airspace Control

2.  **OPERATOR IDENTIFICATION:**
    *   **Action:** Attempt to locate drone operator using direction-finding equipment.
    *   **Responsible Party:** Airspace Control/Designated Security Personnel

3.  **COMMUNICATIONS ATTEMPT:**
    *   **Action:** Airspace Control attempts to contact drone operator via standard drone communication channels (if available).
    *   **Action:** Issue warning to cease operation and land immediately.
    *   **Responsible Party:** Airspace Control

4.  **PROTOCOL ESCALATION:**
    *   **Action:** If no communication is established and drone remains within the geo-fence, escalate to Step III.
    *   **Responsible Party:** Supervisor On-Duty

**C. INTERVENTION & MITIGATION (15-30 Minutes):**

1.  **SOFT INTERVENTION (Preferred):**
    *   **Action:** If possible, deploy drone countermeasures (jamming) to force landing in a pre-designated secure zone.
    *   **Action:** Security Team Bravo deploys to secure the landing zone.
    *   **Responsible Party:** Airspace Control (Jamming), Security Team Bravo (Landing Zone)

2.  **HARD INTERVENTION (If Necessary):**
    *   **Action:** If jamming fails or drone poses imminent threat, authorized personnel (designated by Supervisor) may deploy drone interdiction measures (e.g., net gun, drone interceptor).
    *   **Responsible Party:** Authorized Personnel (Designated by Supervisor)

3.  **POST-INTERVENTION:**
    *   **Action:** Secure drone, document its characteristics, and preserve evidence.
    *   **Action:** Notify law enforcement (if necessary).
    *   **Responsible Party:** Security Team Bravo, Supervisor On-Duty

4.  **INCIDENT REPORT:**
    *   **Action:** Supervisor On-Duty to initiate a detailed incident report, including timeline, actions taken, and lessons learned.
    *   **Responsible Party:** Supervisor On-Duty

**IV. PERSONNEL REQUIRED**

*   **Security Team Alpha:** Visual confirmation, observation.
*   **Security Team Bravo:** Landing zone security, evidence preservation.
*   **Airspace Control:** Drone tracking, communication, geo-fence management.
*   **Supervisor On-Duty:** Overall coordination, escalation decisions, incident report.
*   **Authorized Personnel:** (Designated by Supervisor) - Deployment of drone interdiction measures (if required).
*   **Law Enforcement:** (If necessary) - Investigation, legal action.

**V. CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES**

*   **Geo-fencing:** Prevent drone from entering or leaving a designated area.
*   **Jamming:** Disrupt drone's communication and navigation.
*   **Interdiction:** Physically disable or capture the drone.
*   **Secure Landing Zone:** Confine drone after soft intervention.
*   **Evidence Preservation:** Maintain chain of custody, photograph, document, and prevent tampering of the drone.

**VI. RESOURCES REQUIRED**

1.  **Personnel:**
    *   Security Team Alpha
    *   Security Team Bravo
    *   Airspace Control Personnel
    *   Supervisor On-Duty
    *   Authorized Personnel (Designated by Supervisor for Interdiction)
    *   Law Enforcement Personnel (if necessary)

2.  **Equipment:**
    *   Secondary Drone Detection System (visual, radar)
    *   Direction-Finding Equipment (for locating drone operator)
    *   Drone Communication Equipment (for contacting drone operator)
    *   Drone Countermeasures (Jamming Device)
    *   Drone Interdiction Measures (Net Gun, Drone Interceptor - if necessary)
    *   Evidence Collection Supplies (bags, tags, markers, camera)
    *   Communication Devices (radios, phones)

3.  **Vehicles:**
    *   Vehicles for Security Teams Alpha and Bravo (as needed for deployment)

4.  **Technology/Systems:**
    *   Airspace Monitoring System
    *   Geo-fencing System

    *   Observation Point for Security Team Alpha

6.  **Other:**
    *   Communication Channels (with drone operator, airspace control, security teams)
    *   Established Protocols for Drone Interdiction
    *   Pre-approved Authority to contact and coordinate with Law Enforcement

**VII. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS**

*   All personnel involved in the response must maintain clear and constant communication.
*   Airspace Control serves as the central communication hub, relaying information between teams and the Supervisor On-Duty.
*   Use designated communication channels (radios, phones) to avoid interference.
